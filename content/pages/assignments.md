## Midterm Exam 

The exam will consist of 6 short-answer questions covering the material of the first 9 weeks. Most of the questions will be drawn from a list posted during Week 8. Others may be drawn from the questions in the weekly reading guides.

The exam will count for 30% of the final course grade.

## Final Paper

The final paper must be between 4000 and 5000 words and should either address in greater depth one of the case studies explored in class or develop a different case defined by an activist, movement, or event involving science activism after 1945 anywhere around the world.

Sample topics include:

- An analysis of Soviet nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov’s 1968 article “{{% resource_link "de2bd8b3-ceda-4097-b738-681626789e44" "Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom" %}}”
- The 2017 {{% resource_link "62bf20f8-81ae-4d0e-87bf-542ed1b7c183" "March for Science" %}}
- Examples of science activism from MIT

For some topics, the {{% resource_link "3ee2e868-b181-4be0-936f-2e779e16fa05" "MIT Archives" %}} and the {{% resource_link "12f7eadd-def5-49bb-a923-ecad1ce40e98" "MIT Museum" %}} will provide useful material not found elsewhere.

The final paper should include an introduction, literature review, description of the case study, analysis, and conclusions. Each student will prepare a 15-minute presentation of the idea for this paper in weeks 7 through 9 before the paper is due during week 12 and will participate in the discussion of other students’ ideas.

The final paper will count for 30% of the final course grade.
